  Abstract                 = {Using the large hadron calorimeter of the KASCADE experiment, hadronic cores of extensive air showers have been studied. The hadron lateral and energy distributions have been investigated in order to study the reliability of the shower simulation program CORSIKA with respect to particle transport, decays, treatment of low-energy particles, etc. A good description of the data has been found at large distances from the shower core for several interaction models. The inner part of the hadron distribution, on the other hand, reveals pronounced differences among interaction models. Several hadronic observables are compared with CORSIKA simulations using the QGSJET, VENUS and SIBYLL models. QGSJET reproduces the hadronic distributions best. At the highest energy, in the 10 PeV region, however, none of these models can describe the experimental data satisfactorily. The expected number of hadrons in a shower is too large compared with the observed number, when the data are classified according to the muonic shower size.},

  Abstract                 = {Using data collected at the Pierre Auger Observatory during the past 3.7 years, we demonstrated a correlation between the arrival directions of cosmic rays with energy above 6 x 1019 electron volts and the positions of active galactic nuclei (AGN) lying within [~]75 megaparsecs. We rejected the hypothesis of an isotropic distribution of these cosmic rays with at least a 99% confidence level from a prescribed a priori test. The correlation we observed is compatible with the hypothesis that the highest-energy particles originate from nearby extragalactic sources whose flux has not been substantially reduced by interaction with the cosmic background radiation. AGN or objects having a similar spatial distribution are possible sources.},

  Abstract                 = {The southern part of the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) is nearing completion in the province of Mendoza, Argentina. Since 2004 the instrument is used to take air shower data at the highest energies [1]. The energy threshold of the 3000 kmÂ² surface array of 1600 particle detectors for high quality air shower reconstruction is about 3 . 1018 eV. The 24 Auger fluorescence telescopes (FD), located in four âeyeâ stations at the edge of the detector array, enable precise air shower measure-ments even at primary energies below 1018 eV. The Auger Collaboration has decided to further expand its energy range down to 1017 eV after completion of the southern observatory around the end of 2007 by three additional fluorescence telescopes with an elevated field of view from 30o to 60o above the horizon. It is foreseen to use these High Elevation Auger Telescopes (HEAT) in combination with the existing telescopes at one of the four existing FD sites (Coihueco) as well as in hybrid mode using the shower particle data from a new infill detector area of about 25 kmÂ² with fourfold sampling density â close to HEAT and in the field of view of the new telescopes. This SD infill array (AMIGA) will also be equipped with large area muon detectors [2]. In addition, it will be a perfectly suited test area for the development of novel detection techniques for air showers at ultrahigh energies [3].},

  Abstract                 = {The authors define ââultrahigh-energy cosmic raysââ (UHECRs) as those cosmic rays with energies
above 1018 eV. It had been anticipated that there would be a cutoff in the energy spectrum of primary
cosmic rays around 631019 eV induced by the interaction of the particles with the 2.7-K primordial
photons. However, recent experimental data have established that particles exist with energies greatly
exceeding this. It follows that the sources of such particles are probably nearby, on a cosmological
scale. However, although the trajectories of such energetic particles through the galactic and
intergalactic magnetic fields may be nearly rectilinear, no astronomical sources have as yet been
identified. This is the enigma of the highest-energy cosmic rays. The paper reviews the history of
research in this energy regime and critically assesses the observational results on the energy spectrum,
arrival directions, and composition of the primary cosmic rays based on observations made by six
experiments. The detection methods currently available are described. Special techniques have been
developed as particles of 1020 eV or higher occur at a rate of only about 1 per km2 per century. Errors
in measurement are given particular attention. The authors also review the theoretical predictions for
a number of candidate sources of cosmic rays beyond the predicted cutoff. Finally, the four major
projects planned to address the question of the origin of UHECRs are briefly described.},

  Abstract                 = {To determine the size of an extensive air shower it is not necessary
to have knowledge of the function that describes the fall-off of signal
size from the shower core (the lateral distribution function). In this
paper an analysis with a simple Monte Carlo model is used to show that
an optimum ground parameter can be identified for each individual
shower. At this optimal core distance, ropt, the fluctuations in the
expected signal, S(ropt), due to a lack of knowledge of the lateral
distribution function are minimised. Furthermore it is shown that
the optimum ground parameter is determined primarily by the array
geometry, with little dependence on the energy or zenith angle of the
shower or choice of lateral distribution function. For an array such as
the Pierre Auger Southern Observatory, with detectors separated by
1500 m in a triangular configuration, the optimum distance at which
to measure this characteristic signal is close to 1000 m.},
