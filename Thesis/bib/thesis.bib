  abstract = {In this contribution, we present the latest updates on the energy spectrum characterization obtained with data from the Pierre Auger Observatory. We present the measurement of the spectrum from 6×1015 eV up to above 1020 eV, obtained by combining five different methods. The exposure of over 80,000 km2 sr yr has been accumulated above the ankle region, making this the best estimate of the spectrum ever achieved in this energy range. The wide zenith angle range covered by the Pierre Auger Observatory and the enormous exposure also allow us to measure the spectrum in different regions of the sky. After a description of the techniques used to reconstruct the spectrum, the spectral features will be presented, and the astrophysical implications of the spectral shape will be briefly discussed.},
