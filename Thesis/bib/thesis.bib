  abstract      = {Some super Earths and mini Neptunes will likely have thick atmospheres that are not H2-dominated. We have developed a photochemistry-thermochemistry kinetic-transport model for exploring the compositions of thick atmospheres on super Earths and mini Neptunes, applicable for both H2-dominated atmospheres and non-H2-dominated atmospheres. Using this model to study thick atmospheres for wide ranges of temperatures and elemental abundances, we classify them into hydrogen-rich atmospheres, water-rich atmospheres, oxygen-rich atmospheres, and hydrocarbon-rich atmospheres. We find that carbon has to be in the form of CO2 rather than CH4 or CO in a H2-depleted water-dominated thick atmosphere, and that the preferred loss of light elements from an oxygen-poor carbon-rich atmosphere leads to formation of unsaturated hydrocarbons (C2H2 and C2H4). We apply our self-consistent atmosphere models to compute spectra and diagnostic features for known transiting low-mass exoplanets GJ 1214 b, HD 97658 b, and 55 Cnc e. For GJ 1214 b like planets we find that (1) C2H2 features at 1.0 and 1.5 micron in transmission and C2H2 and C2H4 features at 9-14 micron in thermal emission are diagnostic for hydrocarbon-rich atmospheres; (2) a detection of water-vapor features and a confirmation of nonexistence of methane features would provide sufficient evidence for a water-dominated atmosphere. In general, our simulations show that chemical stability has to be taken into account when interpreting the spectrum of a super Earth/mini Neptune. Water-dominated atmospheres only exist for carbon to oxygen ratios much lower than the solar ratio, suggesting that this kind of atmospheres could be rare.},

  abstract      = {We investigate the potential for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to detect and characterize the atmospheres of the sub-Neptunian exoplanets in the TOI-270 system. Sub-Neptunes are considered more likely to be water worlds than gas dwarfs. We model their atmospheres using three atmospheric compositions - two examples of hydrogen-dominated atmospheres and a water-dominated atmosphere. We then simulate the infrared transmission spectra of these atmospheres for JWST instrument modes optimized for transit observation of exoplanet atmospheres : NIRISS, NIRSpec and MIRI. We then predict the observability of each exoplanet's atmosphere. TOI-270c and d are excellent targets for detecting atmospheres with JWST transmission spectroscopy, requiring only 1 transit observation with NIRISS, NIRSpec and MIRI; higher signal-to-noise (SNR) can be obtained for a clear H-rich atmosphere. Fewer than 3 transits with NIRISS and NIRSpec may be enough to reveal molecular features. Water-dominated atmospheres require more transits. Water spectral features in water-dominated atmospheres may be detectable with NIRISS in 2 or 3 transits. We find that the detection of spectral features in a cloudy, H-rich atmosphere does not require integrations as long as those required for the water-dominated atmosphere, which is consistent with the differences in atmospheric mean molecular weight. TOI-270c and d could be prime targets for JWST transit observations of sub-Neptune atmospheres. These results provide useful predictions for observers who may propose to use JWST to detect and characterize the TOI-270 planet atmospheres.},

  abstract      = {Atmosphere light value is a highly critical parameter in defogging algorithms that are based on an atmosphere scattering model. Any error in atmosphere light value will produce a direct impact on the accuracy of scattering computation and thus bring chromatic distortion to restored images. To address this problem, this paper propose a method that relies on clustering statistics to estimate atmosphere light value. It starts by selecting in the original image some potential atmosphere light source points, which are grouped into point clusters by means of clustering technique. From these clusters, a number of clusters containing candidate atmosphere light source points are selected, the points are then analyzed statistically, and the cluster containing the most candidate points is used for estimating atmosphere light value. The mean brightness vector of the candidate atmosphere light points in the chosen point cluster is taken as the estimate of atmosphere light value, while their geometric center in the image is accepted as the location of atmosphere light. Experimental results suggest that this statistics clustering method produces more accurate atmosphere brightness vectors and light source locations. This accuracy translates to, from a subjective perspective, more natural defogging effect on the one hand and to the improvement in various objective image quality indicators on the other hand.},
