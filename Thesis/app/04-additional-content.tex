\section{Approximation to the upper limit of the UV irradiance of an EAS}
\label{app:cr-uv-irradiance}

In the following, we estimate the UV irradiance, $I_\text{UV}$, or Wattage 
deposited per area, from fluorescence light stemming from an extensive air 
shower. To illustrate that telescopes need to be incredibly sensitive to 
observe this phenomenon, we assume fantastic to unrealistically good conditions
for the \UV light yield and related parameters. This thus results in a very 
optimistic upper limit to $I_\text{UV}$.

Consider a primary particle with energy $E_0 = \SI{e20}{\eV}$. For the sake of 
this exercise, we will assume that the \textit{entire} energy $E_0$ of the \CR 
is converted to excitations of $\text{N}_2$-molecules in the air. 



$\text{N}_2$ is the 2P(0,0)
transition \cite{Ave2008}, which lies at $\lambda=\SI{337.1}{\nano\meter}$.
