\section{Approximation to the upper limit of the UV irradiance of an EAS}
\label{app:cr-uv-irradiance}

In the following, we estimate the UV irradiance by fluorescence of an extensive 
air shower. To showcase that telescopes need to be incredibly sensitive, we 
assume fantastic to unrealistically good conditions for UV light yield, to 
arrive at an upper estimate for the Wattage deposited per area from fluorescence
light stemming from an extensive air shower.

Consider a primary proton with energy $E_0 = \SI{e20}{\eV}$.
