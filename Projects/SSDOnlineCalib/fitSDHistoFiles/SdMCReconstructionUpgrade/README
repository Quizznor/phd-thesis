Configuration for SD reconstruction of simulated events.  While the
reconstruction configuration for real data takes station position information
from the database, this configuration uses the ideal station list, which is
read from an XML file.  Note that this configuration does not require database
access.

Please consult the doxygen-generated documentation for details on how to
inspect the configuration files used for this application.
